# Order Flow

Should link with customer service and stock service etc. as we'll want to integrate our order functionality when adding a new customer since the flow is:

-  They call for a service
-  service confirmed
-  dog information and address confirmed
-  upon confirmation they get slotted in
-  from here we can do dog chow stuff and services they require--grooming, training, food, etc
