# cream-paws-server

Backend that offers CRUD functionality to all the concerns denoted in my [Client Repo](https://github.com/brewswain/Cream-paws-client).
This includes Customer, Dog Chow, and Orders, while also having funcitonality for authentication (temporarily disabled)

Oh, something to note is that I'm also using a [custom library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cream-paws-util/common?activeTab=explore) to help ensure that event management and error handling is consistent throughout the entire backend. This is super important because this server is using microservice architecture, and this is my first attempt at it.

The actual implementation might be a bit rough in spots, but overall i'm pretty happy with it!
