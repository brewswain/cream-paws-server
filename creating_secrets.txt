k create secret generic jwt-secret --from-literal=JWT_ KEY=oIqkHeuCkVEuddoR9ktSmhViiu0Oo14Q
JWT_KEY=oIqkHeuCkVEuddoR9ktSmhViiu0Oo14Q
k get secrets

keep in mind this above is only goof for manually creating a couple secrets, an
.env file is better for prod stuff

oh also these keys are manually made up and will be swapped so I don't mind exposing 
them to github
